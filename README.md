```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:health_icons/health_icons.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HealthIcons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Example 1: Basic Heart Icon
              Icon(
                HealthIcons.heart, //Pass IconData to Icon widget
                size: 60.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),

              // Example 2: Medical Advice Icon
              Icon(
                HealthIcons.medicalAdvice, 
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),

               // Example 2: Blood type A+  Icon
              Icon(
                HealthIcons.bloodAP, 
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),


              // Example 4: Rx (Prescription) Icon
              Icon(
                HealthIcons.rx, 
                size: 45.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),

              // You can find a comprehensive list of all available icons
              // by Browse the `lib/health_icons.dart` file in the package,
              // or by referring to the healthicons.org website for icon names.
              Text('Explore more health icons!'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Finding Icons

The best way to find the specific icon you need is to visit [healthicons.org](https://healthicons.org/). Each icon on their website corresponds directly to an icon in this package. For example, if you see an icon named "heart" on their site, you'll likely find it as `HealthIcons.heart` in this package. Many icons also have `_fill` and `_outline` variants. (currently this package only support filled)
